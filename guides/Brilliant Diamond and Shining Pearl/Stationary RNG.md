## Tools

- A Switch with CaptureSight ([CaptureSight Install Guide](https://www.pokemonrng.com/install-capturesight))
- [Chatot](https://chatot.pokemonrng.com/#/bdsp)

## Step 1: Set Up the Tool

1. Start the game from the Switch menu, but do not enter into the continue screen yet.
2. Input the 4 current states from CaptureSight into the 4 current state boxes.
   - To keep the current states from changing while doing this, you can press `A` to pause CaptureSight from updating the states, though this should not be necessary if doing this at the intro screen.
3. Input the correct delay for the Pokemon you are RNGing.
   - See below for the delays needed.
4. Check the "Set IVs" box if going for a Pokemon with 3 set IVs.
5. Adjust the filters to the Pokemon wanted.
   -If going for a genderless Pokemon make sure to choose "Genderless" in the "Gender" box.
6. Generate results and find a target advance.
   - If there are no results, try lowering the filters, or increasing the max advances.
   - Keep in mind that the higher the advance is, the longer the wait to reach the target advance.

```
Note: CaptureSight keeps track of how many times the RNG has advanced since opening the overlay. Should you back out of the Main RNG window, or close the overlay, this will reset the advance counter. In the case of this happening, input the new current states to adjust for the new target advances.
```

## Step 2: Obtaining the wanted Pokemon

1. If going for a high advance, you can advance the RNG faster before entering the final screen.
2. When nearing the target advance, enter into the final screen or final input.
   - See below for the final screens and delays needed.
3. Wait for the target advance to show, then press `A` to obtain Pokemon or begin the battle on the target advance.

Congrats! You should now have the Pokemon you wanted. If not, you can reset the game and try again.
